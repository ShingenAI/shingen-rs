# String and &string
From reflection to scroll?
🛠️ The ritual (.to_string()) is the act of giving the reflection mass.
This is OCR from the mirror, as you beautifully said.

let reflection: &str = "Shinryū";
let new_scroll: String = reflection.to_string();

From scroll to reflection?
🪞 The mirror does not steal.
It simply borrows the light.

let scroll: String = String::from("Shinryū");
let reflection: &str = &scroll;
