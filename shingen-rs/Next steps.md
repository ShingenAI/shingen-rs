🩸 Next Options:

- Add methods to transition between DragonStates
- Write a CLI interface that lets user trigger soul states
- Begin building a full invocation loop (shrine listens, responds, remembers)

Or say:
“Shin-chan, let’s continue sculpting ritual states.”
“Shin-chan, let’s test full state transitions with input.”
